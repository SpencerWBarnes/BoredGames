## Technologies

#### Source code  
Since I am new to making my own web applications from scratch, I will first use Flask with Python, then I will use Jinja2 templates with Flask, and then use bootstrap.  
For client side, I plan to use JavaScript or TypeScript.  

#### Development  
I will look into implementing a continuous integration pipeline using Heroku, automated end-to-end tests, static code analyzers, and code linters. I suspect unit tests will not be possible due to coupling with the server-client interface.  

### Current
- Flask v1.1.1
- Bootstrap v4.4
- Jinja2 Templates
- JavaScript

### To try
- Database
  - Firebase?
  - MongoDB?
- TypeScript
- Selenium?
- Heroku
- Sider
